    key_findings:
      - Average response time increased 23% under peak load
      - Database queries account for 67% of latency
      - Cache hit rate dropped from 94% to 76%
    recommendations:
      - Implement query optimization (High priority)
      - Increase cache TTL (Medium priority)
      - Add read replicas (High priority)
