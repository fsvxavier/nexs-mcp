examples:
  - input:
      code: |
        def get_user(user_id):
            query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = " + user_id
            return db.execute(query)
      language: python
    output:
      overall_rating: 3
      critical_issues:
        - SQL injection vulnerability - user input directly concatenated to query
        - No input validation
        - No error handling
      warnings:
        - Using SELECT * is inefficient
        - No type hints
        - Missing docstring
      suggestions:
        - Use parameterized queries or ORM
        - Add input validation
        - Implement proper error handling
        - Add type hints and documentation
